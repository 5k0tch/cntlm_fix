# cntlm_fix
Simple Python script to fix the hashes generated by CNTLM (https://sourceforge.net/projects/cntlm/) so that they can be cracked with hashcat etc.

# Requirements

Requires opencv-python

``pip3 install opencv-python``

# Usage

``python3 cntlm_fix.py <HASH>``

```
$ python3 cntlm_fix.py F84F7F07C1FD2831ACC2A522C07E13DD
07B080F83E02D7CE533D5ADD3F81EC22
```

# Why?

CNTLM allows users to cache NTLM credentials by running ``cntlm -H -u <username> -d <domain>``.
This will store an NTLMv2, NTLM and LM hash in cntlm.ini for future use.

Of course storing these hashes in a plain text file would be a terrible idea right? So the devs decided to reverse the character set for the hash, meaning that 0=F, 1=E etc. 

This script will swap the HEX back so it becomes the actual hash for the password that can then be cracked by tools such as hashcat and JtR.
